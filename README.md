# Face-Recognition-
Face Recognition using FaceNets 


This code helps in facial recognition using facenets (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf). The concept of facenets was originally presented in a research paper. The main concepts talked about triplet loss function to compare images of different person. This concept uses inception network which has been taken from source and fr_utils.py is taken from deeplearning.ai for reference. I have added several functionalities of my own for providing stability and better detection.

## Description
A facial recognition system is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or a video frame from a video source. There are multiples methods in which facial recognition systems work, but in general, they work by comparing selected facial features from given image with faces within a database.
